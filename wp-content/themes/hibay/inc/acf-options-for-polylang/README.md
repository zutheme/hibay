# BEA - ACF Options For Polylang

You are using Advanced Custom Fields for creating option pages and you have Polylang installed for awsome multilingual site ?

Sadly, Polylang is not handling ACF's Option Pages. Which means values will be the same for all languages you have set :(

We are here to save your life ! Once this plugin is activated, you will be able to set a different value for each language, and if none is set, the "All languages" value will be used as default one.

# How ?

This plugin is storing a value for each language into database. <b>That means at activation, all data will not be anymore available, but still in database.</b>Then Polylang's lang is used to get the values from the DB. Simply contribute your option page by selecting the Polylang's language from admin flags ui.

# Requirements

- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) 4.7+
- Tested up to 4.9.4
- PHP 5.6
- [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro) 5.6.0+
- [Polylang](https://polylang.pro/)

# Installation

Once activated Polylang's languages into admin area will affect ACF's options pages. 

## WordPress

- Download and install using the built-in WordPress plugin installer.
- Site activate in the "Plugins" area of the admin.

## For developpers

The plugin is designed to get the Polylang "All languages" value if the current lang one is empty. But if you are not interested about this behaviour, you can programmatically deactivate it using the following filter by setting to false : `bea.aofp.get_default`.
